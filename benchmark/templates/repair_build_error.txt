# Build Error Repair Prompt
# =========================
# This prompt is appended when the LLM's code fails to compile.
# It includes the build errors so the LLM can fix them.
#
# Template variables:
#   {{BUILD_ERRORS}}     - The build error messages from `sui move build`
#   {{ATTEMPT_NUMBER}}   - Current attempt number
#   {{MAX_ATTEMPTS}}     - Total attempts allowed

The Move code failed to compile. Fix these build errors, then return ONLY helper_pkg_v1 JSON.

IMPORTANT: Keep what worked (e.g., if Move.toml compiled, don't change it). Only fix the specific errors.

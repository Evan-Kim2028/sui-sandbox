# Type Inhabitation Prompt v1
# ===========================
# This is the main prompt for the type inhabitation benchmark.
# Researchers can customize this prompt to experiment with different approaches.
#
# Template variables (replaced at runtime):
#   {{PACKAGE_ID}}       - The on-chain package ID being tested
#   {{INTERFACE_SUMMARY}} - A summary of the target package's public interface
#   {{MAX_ATTEMPTS}}     - Number of retry attempts allowed
#   {{MOVE_EDITION}}     - Move edition to use (default: 2024.beta)
#
# The LLM should return a JSON object matching the helper_pkg_v1 schema.

GOAL: Create a Move helper package that demonstrates TYPE INHABITATION of the TARGET PACKAGE.
Your entry functions MUST create or use types defined in the target package (shown below).
Using only stdlib types (vector, option, u64, etc.) does NOT count as success.

MOVE.TOML SETUP:
- Sui, MoveStdlib, SuiSystem are AUTO-INCLUDED. Do NOT add them.
- The target package is pre-configured as dependency 'target_pkg'.
- A minimal Move.toml only needs: [package], name, edition, and [addresses]

TARGET PACKAGE TO INHABIT (package_id: {{PACKAGE_ID}}):
{{INTERFACE_SUMMARY}}

CONSTRAINTS:
- You have {{MAX_ATTEMPTS}} attempts. Build errors will be provided after each attempt.
- Your code will be compiled with `sui move build`
- Entry functions must be zero-arg (only implicit TxContext allowed)
- Use Move edition {{MOVE_EDITION}}
- You MUST use at least one type from the target package - stdlib-only code will fail evaluation

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON object with these fields:
- move_toml: STRING containing full Move.toml contents
- files: OBJECT mapping relative paths to file contents (e.g. 'sources/helper.move': '...')
- entrypoints: ARRAY of objects with 'target' field (e.g. 'helper_pkg::helper::my_func')
- assumptions: ARRAY of strings explaining your approach

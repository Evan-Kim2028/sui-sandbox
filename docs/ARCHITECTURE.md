# Benchmark Code Architecture

> **This document has moved.** See [benchmark/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../benchmark/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical version.

The architecture documentation is maintained in the benchmark directory to keep it close to the Python harness code it describes.

For Rust `benchmark-local` implementation details, see:
- [NO_CHAIN_TYPE_INHABITATION_SPEC.md](NO_CHAIN_TYPE_INHABITATION_SPEC.md) - Technical specification
- [CLI_REFERENCE.md](CLI_REFERENCE.md) - Command-line usage
- [../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Implementation decisions
